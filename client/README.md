# TypeScript Chat Client React

* **This is a fork of [Luis Aviles'](https://luixaviles.com/) Socket.IO/TypeScript/Angular example, that you can find [on Github](https://github.com/luixaviles/socket-io-typescript-chat).**

* **Work in progress!**

## Run the React frontend

First, please make sure, that the **backend is running** (see README.md in top-level folder).

Then run the following commands in this `client-react` folder from the terminal:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

The React-based frontend then runs on http://localhost:4300

Note: of course you can run the original Angular frontend as well. Then you can happily chat between React and Angular ðŸ˜Š
